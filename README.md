# CDP-BCD
These are the codes of the dual-population coevolutionary algorithm for the MMOP (CDP-BCD) proposed in "Li Z, Rong H, Yang S, et al. A dual-population coevolutionary algorithm for balancing convergence and diversity in the decision space in multimodal multi-objective optimization[J]. Applied Soft Computing, 2024: 111770."

The codes use PlatEMO (v3.4) published in "Ye Tian et al., PlatEMO: A MATLAB Platform for Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization, IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 2017, 12(4): 73-87".
